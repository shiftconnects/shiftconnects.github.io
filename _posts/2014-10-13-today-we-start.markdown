Today is a big day for SHIFT. After more than a year of work we welcomed our first members. Over the last year we’ve built a lot of things:

* In-car hardware and software that rivals any car sharing company on the planet.
* Not only member-facing iOS and Android applications but internal-facing applications in both to manage our rebalancing and system support operations.
* A dedicated team of Connectors focused on rebalancing and maintaining a fleet that’s within five minutes of all of our members in our core service area.
* An intelligent backend platform designed to see the future and place cars, bikes and rides where you’ll need them even before you know you do.
*Most importantly a team of 30+ of the most intelligent, passionate people I’ve ever worked with.

The future for SHIFT is bright. We’re excited to be able to bring our vision to members to help them connect with the places and experiences they care about. Our mission is to connect the dots between you and your city. We’re doing it now in Las Vegas and early in 2015 we’ll be doing it in a second city.

Over the next few months we’ll enable our members to do so many more things in a day than they can now. We’ll connect them to places closeby but too far to walk. We’ll connect them to experiences they otherwise would miss. We believe that we can fundamentally change how our members interact with their cities and how cities develop themselves.

Today we took a big step in that direction. Come join us.
