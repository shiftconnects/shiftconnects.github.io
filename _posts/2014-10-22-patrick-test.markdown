When you think about SHIFT, you probably imagine our unique vehicles, awesome mobile application or great customer service. And those are the experiences we want you to think about. But behind the scenes, SHIFT has set industry-leading safety standards that allow you to connect with the people and places you care about.

A team of Connectors works around the clock to make sure SHIFT’s on-ground operations function smoothly and safely. So, what does a Connector do? Anything a member needs for SHIFT to integrate seamlessly with your life. Our Connectors provide a variety of tasks, many of which you may not realize. They:

- make sure vehicles and bicycles are properly distributed throughout the city
- make sure vehicles and bicycles are mechanically sound
- keep the interior and exterior of vehicles clean
- rotate vehicles through our Nerve Center so they have enough electric charge (or gasoline, if applicable) to get you to your destination 
- maintain the cleanliness and security of our stations
- provide roadside assistance whenever a vehicle or bicycle falters
- ensure your mobile application, RFID card, and the vehicle hardware are all properly functioning
- appear on site if you are having any technical difficulties that can’t be resolved remotely
- answer all phone calls (whether you are asking questions about our services, resolving a problem, or even asking for a restaurant recommendation)
- provide Valet+ service by delivering your vehicle to you, taking you to your destination, and returning the vehicle on your behalf
- step up to the plate to take on whatever the task du jour might be to keep SHIFT running smoothly and to keep our members safe, happy and moving

Simply put, our Connectors make sure SHIFT works. If being a Connector sounds like a lot of responsibility, that’s because it is. And SHIFT has set a high bar to ensure that every Connector is up to the task. 

Before hiring a Connector, SHIFT does a thorough background check encompassing local, state, and federal databases, including criminal records, the sex offender registry, and driving records. Specifically, an applicant’s Motor Vehicle Report cannot show: 
1. any history of impaired driving
2. any major moving violation over the past three years
3. more than three minor infractions over the past three years. 

In other words, if we have any reason to believe that applicant won’t be safe on the road, they don’t make the cut. Additionally, applicants must pass an initial drug screening and a physical examination (using 49 CFR 391.41 as a guideline; only applicable to Connectors who provide Valet+ services) to make sure they are ready to meet the rigors of the position. Once hired, Connectors face continuous monitoring of their driving records, random drug testing, routine criminal record reviews and physical examination checkups.

Connectors also go through a classroom and in-the-field training program to best prepare them for their first day on the job. In addition to knowing the ins-and-outs of SHIFT’s system, the training bolsters the Connectors’ knowledge of the streets, shortcuts, traffic patterns, and popular destinations. By intimately knowing both the SHIFT system and the city, Connectors can remain focused on helping you move whenever and wherever you wish.

So next time you see a Connector, remember they are a big reason that SHIFT keeps you connected with your city… safely.
