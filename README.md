**Rules of the Road**

# Always publish to the drafts repository and submit a pull request to merge to master to have it pushed live after review.
# You can use any editor to write posts, an easy one is [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/).
# If you are uploading photos, you'll need to upload them into /public/images and link them using markdown with this directory (/public/images/file_name.ext)
